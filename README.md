# Social Network Api with MongoDB

# Hello there, my name is Alexander Giannini and this is my social network API project. The purpose of this project was to create various API routes for my social network, using User and Thought models. The User model includes various properties like username, email, friends, and thoughts. Basically, the user can have a friends list as well as "thoughts". The Thought model is dependent of the user model and has various properties as well. A "Reaction" Schema is built upon the User model and you can basically react to any thoughts. This application can be tested on Insomnia and can test all CRUD operations, and this application was built with both Mongoose and Express packages. Hope you enjoy!
